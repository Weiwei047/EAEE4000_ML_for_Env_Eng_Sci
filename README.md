### Fall 2022 https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/154958

A project-based learning course to devlop understanding of the latest ML techniques
W 4:10-6:40PM
Instructor: Pierre Gentine (www.gentine.com), pg2328@columbia.edu

Prerequisite: 
Computer language (Python or Julia), some linear algebra 

Description: This class aims at understanding and testing state-of-the-art methods in machine learning applied to environmental sciences and engineering problems. Potential applications include but are not limited to remote sensing, and environmental and geophysical fluid dynamics. 
The first weeks will be dedicated to testing “vanilla” ML algorithms to simple problems – introducing the concept of tensorflow, pytorch and notebooks. We will cover feedforward neural networks, shallow vs deep networks, regression trees, random forests, XG Boost on a few simple examples. We will also discuss the details of machine learning techniques such as hyperparameters, batch sizes, optimization techniques and assumptions on the distributions. We will then cover Convolutional Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Networks.
The remaining of the course will be based on paper reading, a project and in-class tutorials on more advanced machine learning models (e.g. variational autoencoders, generative models, transfer learning and metalearning). 
We will then present Gaussian Processes and the role of uncertainties in models and link this to recent developments on Bayesian Neural Networks and ensemble methods for aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. 
We will finally discuss causal inference and Directed Acyclic Graphs and how they can help go beyond traditional machine learning.

Grading: course grading will be split into 35% for the in-class presentation of a paper and 65% for the project.
